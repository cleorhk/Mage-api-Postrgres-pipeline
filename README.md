# Mage-api-Postrgres-pipeline
This project implements a data pipeline using Mage, Docker, and PostgreSQL. The pipeline fetches intraday stock data from the Alpha Vantage API, performs transformations, and exports the processed data to a PostgreSQL database. The project is designed to run automatically at specified intervals, ensuring up-to-date data collection and processing.
